# UD CIS Discord GitHub IO page
The repo contains the documentation for the UD CIS Discord which is used to make out website.
This repo is the place where we keep our docs up to date. Commits shouldâ„¢ automatically roll out to Canvas through GitHub actions and waltz. To make sure this works, the Canvas API token should be placed as a secrete on this repo. This token will change as maintainers come and go. Currently, it is tied to Ben's external Canvas account.
