If you don't already have a discord account, click [here](https://discord.com/register, "Welcome to discord") to create one!
Make sure you have verified your email address as you won't be able to join the server until you have. Once you have your
account setup, find the server invite link on your courses canvas page. If it's not there or has expired, [email Ben](mailto:bensegal@udel.edu)
with the name of the course you are taking and an invite link will be sent back to you. If you have never used discord before
you may want to check out [Discord's Beginners Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord "Get learnt").
Once you are on the server you are almost ready to go. Students, head over [here](./students/ "Let's go") for instructions on getting verified! Professors
and TAs, click [here](./teachers/ "Teaching time").
