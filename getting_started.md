If you don't already have a discord account, click [here](https://discord.com/register "Welcome to discord") to create one!
Make sure you have verified your email address as you won't be able to join the server until you have. Once you have your
account setup, find the server invite link on your courses canvas page. If it's not there or has expired, [email Ben](mailto:bensegal@udel.edu)
with the name of the course you are taking and an invite link will be sent back to you. If you have never used discord before
you may want to check out [Discord's Beginners Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord "Get learnt").
Once you are on the server you are almost ready to go. Students, head over [here](/verify/students/ "Let's go") for instructions on getting verified!
Professors and TAs, click [here](/verify/teachers/ "Teaching time").

## Roles
***
If you don't know, Discord uses Roles to give users permissions and as tags. Roles allow staff to post announcements and give names their colors. You can
use Sage to assign yourself some roles that will help the staff to help you. To see the list send `s;assign list` in <span style="color:#738adb;">#sages_place</span> and you can give yourself one of those roles using `s;assign <role name>`. There is a role for each class and we ask that you assign yourself the role
for your class. If you are in more than one CISC class, assign more than one role! We also pronoun roles. They are optional but can be helpful for knowing 
what pronouns a member uses. They are assigned the same way and if your pronouns aren't on the list just let Ben know and he'll be happy to add them.

## Channels
***
We've got a lot of channels so we have broken them up into categories. We have two categories non-course specific conversation in addition to a 
category for each course. Our channels list changes every now and again but we will try to keep the list below up to date.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">ðŸ“£announcements</span>\
This is where all server wide announcements will be posted. Information about Discord outages will also be posted here (assuming messages can 
be sent during the outage). We recommend adding a
<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258-Notifications-Settings-101#h_570c11eb-b007-4e7c-8ae8-77515ea40c6a" 
target="_blank">notification override</a> for this channel so you always know what's going on.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#general</span>\
As it says in the name, this channel is for general chatting. Talk about computer science or not! Anything goes here. Sage doesn't keep 
track of messages here so chatting with your friends wont give you participation points.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#not_so_general</span>\
This is just like <span style="color:#738adb;">#general</span>, you can chat about anything here. Why have two channels with the same
purpose you ask? Its because there are a lot of you and sometime people want to have more than one conversation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#sages_place</span>\
You can go wild with Sage commands here. Set all the reminders, rate all the things, ask the 8ball a million questions! Go nuts!
