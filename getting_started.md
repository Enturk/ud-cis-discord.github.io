***
If you don't already have a Discord account, click [here](https://discord.com/register "Welcome to discord") to create one!
Make sure you have verified your email address as you won't be able to join the server until you have. Once you have your
account setup, find the server invite link on your courses canvas page. If it's not there or has expired, [email Ben](mailto:bensegal@udel.edu)
with the name of the course you are taking and an invite link will be sent back to you. If you have never used Discord before
you may want to check out [Discord's Beginners Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord "Get learnt").
Once you are on the server you are almost ready to go. Students, head over [here](/verify/students/ "Let's go") for instructions on getting verified!
Professors and TAs, click [here](/verify/teachers/ "Teaching time"). Before you get started chatting, make sure you read the rules. You can
do that on the server in <span style="color:#738adb;">#rules</span>, or you can check out the [rules page](/rules/ "Da Rules") here on the website.

## Roles
***
If you don't know, Discord uses Roles to give users permissions and as tags. Roles allow staff to post announcements and display names with different colors. You can
use Sage to assign yourself some roles that will help the staff to help you. To see the list send `s;assign list` in <span style="color:#738adb;">#sages_place</span>
 and you can give yourself one of those roles using `s;assign <role name>`. There is a role for each class and we ask that you assign yourself the role
for your class. If you are in more than one CISC class, assign more than one role! We also have pronoun roles. They are optional but can be helpful for knowing 
what pronouns a member uses. They are assigned the same way and if your pronouns aren't on the list just let Ben know and he'll be happy to add them.

### Awards
<hr style="margin-left: 0px; width: 40%;">

We also have a handful of awards you can earn just by chatting on discord. Just start chatting and Sage will let you know if you have earned a new role.
More awards are added on a regular basis so there is always more to earn.

### Skilled Users
<hr style="margin-left: 0px; width: 40%;">

Has another student been helping you out? If so, nominate them to be a Skilled User! Skilled Users are your fellow students who like to help out and have
a cool looking green name. To nominate another student send, `s;nominate @username` over in <span style="color:#738adb;">#sages_place</span> and the staff
will review the nomination.

## Channels
***
We've got a lot of channels so we have broken them up into categories. We have some categories for non-course specific conversation in addition to a 
category for each course. Our channels list changes every now and again but we will try to keep the list below up to date.

### General Channels
<hr style="margin-left: 0px; width: 40%;">

Messages aren't counted in any of these channels since none of them are for a particular class.\
</br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">ðŸ“£announcements</span>\
This is where all server wide announcements will be posted. Information about Discord outages will also be posted here (assuming messages can 
be sent during the outage). We recommend adding a
<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258-Notifications-Settings-101#h_570c11eb-b007-4e7c-8ae8-77515ea40c6a" 
target="_blank">notification override</a> for this channel so you always know what's going on.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#rules</span>\
This channel lists the rules. Make sure you read through it when you first arrive so know how the server runs.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#general</span>\
As it says in the name, this channel is for general chatting. Talk about computer science or not! Anything goes here. Sage doesn't keep 
track of messages here so chatting with your friends wont give you participation points.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#not_so_general</span>\
This is just like <span style="color:#738adb;">#general</span>, you can chat about anything here. Why have two channels with the same
purpose you ask? Its because there are a lot of you and sometime people want to have more than one conversation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#gaming</span>\
This channel is for any and all gaming related chatting. Weather you want to talk about next gen consoles, computer hardware or that latest
Mario Kart update, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#gaming</span> is the place to do it.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#sages_place</span>\
You can go wild with Sage commands here. Set all the reminders, rate all the things, ask the 8ball a million questions! Go nuts!

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">#voice_0 and ðŸ”ŠVoice 0</span>\
These channels are for voice chat. <span style="color: #738abd">ðŸ”ŠVoice 0</span> is where you can go to talk to other students.
If you want to reference a link or just don't feel like talking, send messages in <span style="color: #738abd">#voice_0</span>!
Why start at 0 you ask? Because we are programmers and we 0 index everything.

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color:#738adb;">ðŸ”ŠAFK</span>\
If you have been chilling, muted & deafened, not touching your mouse and keyboard in a voice chat for 15 minutes, you will automatically
be moved to this voice channel to save some bandwidth for those who aren't Away From Keyboard.

### Class Specific Channels
<hr style="margin-left: 0px; width: 40%;">

Each class has a unique set of channels to serve that particular classes needs. Messages sent in these channels will increase your
count unless specified otherwise in the channel topic. We recommend muting class categories for classes you are not in. To do this
simply right click the category name (or long press if on mobile) and select **Mute Category** then **Until I turn it back on**.
