## Why do I need to get verified?
Staff need to know who you are. Verification associates your Discord user account with you as a real person.
Verification information is only available to staff and no one else. Also, there are some things you won't
be able to do on the server, like sending pictures, until you have been verified. To get verified, simply
follow the link below that applies to you. If both apply to you (looking at you uTAs), go through both
verification processes.
