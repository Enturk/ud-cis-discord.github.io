Why have a bot you ask. It makes my life easier. Thats why!
## Our lovley bot
Our bot, `botname` is  built on top of the Klasa framework and the Discord.js library. `botname` is custom-coded and is
actively maintained by Ben Segal and biased on Steve Bot. `botname` is a a general purpose discord bot, with some added
functionality to make online learning easier. `botname` has a bunch of cool commands you can read about below but that's
not all. `botname` also keeps track of how many messages you send. This information is used by your Professor to give you 
participation points. If you have an idea to improve `botname`, you can send `s;suggest <your idea here>` in a bot spam
channel and it will be sent directly to they eyes of Ben.
