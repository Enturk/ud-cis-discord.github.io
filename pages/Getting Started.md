### New to Discord? Before you do anything else, go [here][0] to make an account.
The CIS department is using Discord as a replacement for Piazza this semester. This is a quick start guide to get you
ready to use the UD CIS Discord for this course. There are more detailed instructions and documentation in the other
pages in this module but this page contains the basics.

Throughout this module, you can replace `000` with your course code. For example General Computer Science for Engineers
is CISC 106 so any `000` would become `106`. An honors section of CISC 106 would become `106-H`.

### Getting Verified

Before you can start sending messages, you need to get verified. You should have already received an email from Sage,
the bot that manages our Discord server. If you have not, you can request one [here][1]. In that email you will find a
link to our gateway server and a unique hash. Join the gateway server and send your hash to Sage in a Direct Message. Sage
will reply by sending you an invite link to the UD CIS Discord server. Once you join the server, you have been verified!

### Enrolling in this class

When you verify, Sage may let you know that you've been automatically enrolled in this class. If you have been
automatically enrolled, great, you can skip the rest of this section. If Sage didn't tell you that you were enrolled in
this course, simply head over to <span style="color:#7289DA">#role_select</span> and find your course(s) in the dropdown menu. Sage will enroll you into any course you select and you'll be given access to their course channels. If you are taking more than one CISC class that is using Discord, don't worry, you can enroll
in as many classes as you need.

### Other Features
