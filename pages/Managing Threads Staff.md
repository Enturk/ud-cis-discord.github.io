A great new feature that we've added this semester is the ability for students to open private threads for private questions. Gone are the days of `s;reply 1234` for private questions! While this change makes things a lot easier for students and staff alike, there are a few management things that you should know about as a staff member. 

# Archiving Threads
As a staff member, you should never be deleting threads that students make for private questions. Instead, archival is the way to go. To archive a thread, you can use the `s;archive` command from within that thread's channel. This will remove it from your channel list until someone decides to unarchive it. 

# Unarchiving Threads
Obviously you or your students will have follow-up questions after a thread has been archived. Have no fear, there's a way to get previously archived threads back up and running! 

1. Click on the pound sign (hashtag, octothorpe, whatever you prefer) in the top right of your course's #general channel: 

    ![Pound sign][1]

2. On the resulting popup, click on "Archived" to see a list of archived threads. Then, click "Private" to see all of the private questions that have been asked. In a non-example situation, there would be a list of threads that you could click. All you need to do from there is to type in a message and the thread will be unarchived and opened for further discussion.
