### About this module

This module is designed to be able to be dropped into any UD Canvas course and function as is. If you would like to make
some parts of the documentation easier for your students, replace any instances of `000` with your course code
(including the H for honors sections) and remove the warning from [Getting Started][11]. Here is all the pages where
replacements could be made: [Getting Started][11], [Verification][12], [Commands][13]. If we update this module, we'll
let you know that you can update it in your course.

### Getting your staff and students setup

In order to make things as easy as possible, we take care of distributing links to the Discord. All we need from you is
two .csv files, one with the emails of all your students all in one column, and one with the emails of all your staff.
We use these lists to kick off the verification process and get everyone on the Discord. We ask that you send these .csv
files to [bensegal+sage-onboard@udel.edu][14]{: .instructure_file_link .inline_disabled} by no later than February 10th.
We'll start sending out emails to Students on the 11th and we'll let you know when we've finished sending them out to
your students.
