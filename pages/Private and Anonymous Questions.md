Sometimes you may want to ask a question to the entire course staff or maybe you want to ask a question to your
classmates anonymously. Discord normally doesn't have this functionality so we've built it into Sage. Asking both
private and anonymous questions is quick and easy to do. To send both private and anonymous questions, you'll need to
send Sage a Direct Message (DM). To do this, find Sage in the members list or in any message Sage has sent and right
click (or tap and hold on mobile) Sage's username. You can then select the message option and you will be brought to a
DM with Sage.

### Asking Private Questions

In your DM with Sage, you can send the word `private` followed by any question and Sage will send that question to your
course staff. If you are enrolled in more than one course on the server, you will need to add the course code after the
word private. Asking a private question looks like this:

![Two Discord messages. The first, sent by a user called Ben855, says "private What's the difference between an Array and an ArrayList?" The second, sent by a bot user called Sage, says "Your question has been sent to the staff, any responses will be sent here. Question ID: 47"][18]

Once the staff have seen your question, they can respond to you right in your DM with Sage. When a staff member replies,
you'll get a message from Sage that looks like this:

![A Discord embedded message. Header: "Ben855#0855 replied to question 47". Content: "An array has a fixed size and an ArrayList can grow". Footer: "To respond do s;reply 47 <response>" .][19]

If you wish to ask a similar question or reply to the staff members message in any way, you can. Simply send `s;reply
<questionID> <response>` and Sage will send your response to the staff.

![Two Discord messages. The first, sent by a user named Ben855, reads "s;reply 47 Are there any disadvantages to using an ArrayList then?" The second, set by a bot user name Sage says "I've forwarded your message along."][20]

### Sending Anonymous Questions

In your DM with Sage, you can send the word `anonymous` (or `anon` for short) followed by any question and Sage will
send that question to your course's general channel. If you are enrolled in more than one course on the server, you will
need to add the course code after the word anonymous. Asking an anonymous question looks like this:

##### (DM above, general chat below)
![Two Discord messages. The first, sent by a user name Ben855, says "anonymous Why do we use pointers?" The second, sent by a bot user named Sage, says "Your question has been sent to your course anonymously. To reply anonymously, use s;reply 43 <response>."][21]
---
![A Discord embed message. The title reads: Anonymous asked Question 43. The content reads: Why do we use pointers?][22]

If you would like to continue the conversation anonymously, you can simply send `s;reply <questionID> <response>` and
sage will send your response to your courses general channel.

![Two Discord messages. The first, sent by a user named Ben855, says "s;reply 43 Okay I understand now, thank you for your explination." The second, sent by a bot user name Sage, says "I've forwarded your message along."][23]
