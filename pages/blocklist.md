The blocklist consists of sensitive, hateful, and/or offensive content that cannot be linked to or sent as an image (EX: you may talk about J.K. Rowling, but linking to a hateful tweet she made is prohibited). Please do not try to evade the blocklist in any way; including, but not limited, to: saying 'it was a joke,' sending it in dms without consent, etc. Blocklist content will result in administrator action.

#### Blocked Content
0. Stonetoss
1. J.K Rowling
<br><span style="font-size: small">*Disclaimer: The blocklist does not include non-hateful content made by ‘bad’ people (ex: Harry Potter). If the creator listed is known for making hateful content, the blocklist applies. This is not a comprehensive list, complaints will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Students can suggest blocklist candidates.</span>
