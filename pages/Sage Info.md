## What is a Discord Bot?

A Discord bot, generally speaking, is a piece of code that can interact with a Discord server in a variety of ways. From
moderation and games to playing music and videos, bots add a lot of extra functionality to any Discord server.

## Why do we need a Discord Bot?

The UD CIS department needs a way to moderate its Discord server and to provide students and staff with the tools
necessary to learn effectively and build a robust community, especially during these unprecedented times. A custom bot
is the perfect way to automate a lot of the functions needed to facilitate the aforementioned goals as we can make on
the fly changes and tailor it to fit the needs of our department.

## What can Sage do?

Sage is the UD CIS department's custom bot and adds a lot of useful functionality to the server. Some of the most
important features of Sage include:

  * A easy to use, robust verification system 
  * Anonymous and private question asking functionality similar to that of Piazza
  * Well documented commands that students and staff can use

If there is a feature that you would like to see in Sage or if you find a bug, you can let us know by creating an issue
on the [public GitHub repository][28] or by contacting us on Discord.
