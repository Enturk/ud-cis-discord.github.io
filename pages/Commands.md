Here is a list of all of the commands available for Sage, with the format `s;[command] [arguments]`:

### General Commands

**help:**  
The help command can take one or no arguments. If no argument is given, you will be sent a DM with a list of all
commands available to you and their descriptions (much like this page).  
If you give a command name as the argument, you will be sent a DM with a detailed description of that command, its
aliases, and its possible arguments. ****

**info:**  
The info command will send a message with in-depth information about our discord bot, Sage.

**serverinfo:**  
The serverinfo command will send a message with information about the UD CIS Discord guild.

**check:**  
The check command can take one or no arguments. If no argument is given, the output from the command will be sent to you
in a DM. If you use the word 'here' as an argument, the output will be sent to the same channel that you used the
command in. The check command will output your current message count and level.

**assign:**  
The assign command can take one or multiple arguments. If you use the command with the word 'list,' you will be sent a
list of all self-assignable roles in the guild. If you give a role name as the argument, Sage will assign you that role
(as long as it is self-assignable).

**enroll:**  
The enroll command is described on the [Getting Started](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2510334/pages/getting-started?module_item_id=41523518){: .instructure_file_link .inline_disabled} page.

**stats:**  
The stats command will display information about Sage's current status (such as uptime, memory usage, etc).

**ping:**  
The ping command will output the amount of time it took Sage to respond to your command, as well as the current
websocket ping.

**discordstatus:**  
The discordstatus command will output the current status of Discord, which can also be found on [this website](https://discordstatus.com/){: .instructure_file_link .inline_disabled}.

**xkcd:**  
The xkcd command will output a random comic, with a description.

**8ball:**  
The 8ball command takes one argument, which must end in a question mark (?). You may ask the 8ball any appropriate
question, and it will output an answer for you.

**rockpaperscissors:**  
The ultimate battle of human vs program. Can you best Sage in a round of rock paper scissors?
