Here you will find all the information you need to get started on the UD CIS Discord server.

## Why Discord?
Discord has been used successfully in the past for CISC courses. Not only does it allow an easy place for questions
and answers, it also helps to grow a community, something that is increasingly difficult during covid-19. Our
hope is that this will become both an education tool and a place for people to chat.

## Ready to get started?
### First, read our [rules](#rules). Then, [hop on over here](/getting_started/).

## <a name="rules"></a>Server Rules
0. Be respectful to everyone. Rudeness will not be tolerated, everyone deserves respect regardless of their individual beliefs and opinions.
1. Discussions are encouraged, but if you have to resort to insults or fallacies to get your point across it is no longer a discussion. Cite your sources for any claims you make.
2. Please keep conversations to relevant channel topics. If a Staff member or Admin asks you to move your conversation, you must listen.
3. Do not spam. This applies to emojis, pictures, messages, pings, etc. Just don't spam.
4. Keep your language appropriate - don't say something you wouldn't say to your professor.
5. Rules for the course you are taking apply here. This includes your professorâ€™s policy about sharing code. If you need to share code to ask a question in your course channels, you must use the private question command. Refer to this link for more information: https://ud-cis-discord.github.io/pages/commands 
6. Respect what the Staff and Admins say, they are in charge for a reason. If they tell you to stop, then stop.
7. The UD Code of Conduct applies to all activity on this server. For more information, refer to the following link: http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/20-21/code.html
