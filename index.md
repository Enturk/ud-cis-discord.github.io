Here you will find all the information you need to get started on the UD CIS Discord server.

## Why Discord?
Discord has been used successfully in the past for CISC courses. Not only does it allow an easy place for questions
and answers, it also helps to grow a community, something that is increasingly difficult during covid-19. Our
hope is that this will become both an education tool and a place for people to chat.
