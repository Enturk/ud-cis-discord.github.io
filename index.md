## Why Discord?
Discord has been used sucessfuly in the past for CISC courses. Not only does it allow an easy place for questions
and answers, it also helps to grow a comunity, something that is increasingly dificult during covid-19. Our
hope is that this will become both an education tool and a place for people to chat.
