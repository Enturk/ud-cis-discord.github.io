Our verification process is going to become a bit more robust in the future but right now, you just have
to tell Sage who you are. To do that simply send the following message directly to Sage. To do this, click
(or tap) on Sage's name at the top of the user list and send the following message, making sure to fill in
your details `s;verify full name|udel.edu email|UDID number`. Sage will send you a message confirming you
have been verified and you are good to go. Once you have done that you will be able to post pictures, add
reactions and self assign roles for your courses.
